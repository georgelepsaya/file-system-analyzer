## Motivation for chosen tools and approach

1. **uv** for project and package management.

Previously I have used both `setuptools` and `poetry` for project and dependency management. However this time I have chosen `uv` as a project and package manager, because it is fast, easy to set up, and I was curious to try a new tool gaining wide adoption recently.

2. **argparse** for command line interface.

I have used `click` and `argparse` in my previous projects and I thought that `argparse` is a good fit for this task.

3. **Functional programming** paradigm.

I went with functional programming since it is more straightforward to start a task with this approach and move to OOP only I find it necessary later on.
